Sujood: Understanding how GitHub works and how to pull the repository locally, work on it and then push the changes back to the remote repo

Hilal: I had used github, but I had used a the github desktop with pycharm around two years ago.However, using it with Vscode and command line was a new experience for me. It helped me to learn how to pull, push, commit, add and learn working with team in more effective way.
